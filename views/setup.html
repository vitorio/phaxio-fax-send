      <h2>
        Hi
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        We need a few more pieces of information to finish setting up the app. This page will track your progress and show which steps you've completed with a checkmark (✅).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This is a basic system that uses Twilio's Fax API to send faxes. To set it up for yourself or your own friend group, you'll need a developer account from Twilio, which is out of scope of this document.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Once you have a funded Twilio account, you'll need a phone number, and two codes from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.twilio.com/console">Twilio Developer Console</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="twilio-phone">
        Twilio Phone Number
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        Buy a phone number from Twilio to send faxes from it.
        This also goes into the <code>.env</code> file of this project:
      </p>
      
      <pre><code># find these at https://www.twilio.com/console
# TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=<mark>"+15551234567"</mark>
# TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
# TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</code></pre>
      
      <h3 id="credentials">
        Account Credentials
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        You'll also need your "Account SID" and "Auth Token", both of which are also in the console. These are secrets, so be sure not to share them with anyone! The values in <code>.env</code> are only visible to the owner of the project, so you can safely paste them there:
      </p>

      <pre><code># find these at https://www.twilio.com/console
# TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER="+15551234567"
# TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<mark>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</mark>
# TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<mark>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</mark>
</code></pre>
      
      <p>
        You'll also need your "Account SID" and "Auth Token", both of which are also in the console. These are secrets, so be sure not to share them with anyone! The values in <code>.env</code> are only visible to the owner of the project, so you can safely paste them there:
      </p>


      <h3 id="secret">
        A Secret!
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        This app will send an SMS to a phone number, and we don't want just anyone to be able to do that! Pick out a secret phrase or password you can use to make sure only you can send a message from the app, and add it to <code>.env</code>
      </p>

      <pre><code># let's not let just anyone text you
SECRET=<mark>XXXXXXXX</mark></code></pre>
