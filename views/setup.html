        👋🏽
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        We need a few more pieces of information to finish setting up the app. This page will track your progress and show which steps you've completed with a checkmark (✅).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This is a basic system that uses Phaxio's API to send faxes. To set it up for yourself or your own friend group, you'll need a developer account from Phaxio, which is out of scope of this document.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Once you have a funded Phaxio account, you'll need two codes from Phaxio's <a target="_blank" href="https://console.phaxio.com/api_credentials">API Keys</a> and one from <a target="_blank" href="https://console.phaxio.com/user/callbacks/edit">Webhooks</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="credentials">
        Account Credentials
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        You'll need your "Account SID" and "Auth Token", both of which are also in the console. These are secrets, so be sure not to share them with anyone! The values in <code>.env</code> are only visible to the owner of the project, so you can safely paste them there:
      </p>

      <pre><code># find these at https://console.phaxio.com/api_credentials
PHAXIOKEY=<mark>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</mark>
PHAXIOSECRET=<mark>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</mark>

# find this at https://console.phaxio.com/user/callbacks/edit
PHAXIOTOKEN=<mark>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</mark>
</code></pre>
      
      <h3 id="secret">
        A Secret!
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        This app will send a real fax to a phone number and charge you money for doing so, and we don't want just anyone to be able to do that! Pick out a secret phrase or password you can use to make sure only you and your friends can send a fax from the app, and add it to <code>.env</code>
      </p>

      <pre><code># let's not let just anyone fax you
SECRET=<mark>XXXXXXXX</mark></code></pre>
