Twilio SMS Demo
===============

This app is a demo of using Twilio's client library for sending SMS and MMS messages. Because it uses Twilio's trial account functionality, it's limited to sending messages to a fixed number. To try it out for yourself, remix this app.


Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
* `views/index.html` is the app's UI
8 `public/style.`
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
