Twilio SMS Demo
===============

This app is a demo of using Twilio's client library for sending SMS and MMS messages. Because it uses Twilio's trial account functionality, it's limited to sending messages to a fixed number. To try it out for yourself, remix this app.

Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
* `views/index.html` is the app's UI
* `public/client.js` (currently blank) is where you can put client-side code
* `views/setup.html` and `public/setup.js` are for the setup helper flow.

On the back-end,
* `server.js` is run when the project starts
* `package.json` contains the app's dependencies
* `.env` contains variables custom to the app we don't want other users to see
