XOXO fax send
=============

This is a basic system that uses Twilio's Fax API to send faxes. To set it up for yourself or your own friend group, you'll need a developer account from Twilio, which is out of scope of this document.

Once you have a funded Twilio account, you'll need a phone number, and two codes from the Twilio Developer Console.

Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
* `views/index.html` is the app's UI
* `public/client.js` has the JavaScript to set up International Telephone Input, the phone number validator and formatter
* `public/style.css` has the page styling
* `views/setup.html` and `public/setup.js` are for the setup helper flow.

On the back-end,
* `server.js` is run when the project starts
* `package.json` contains the app's dependencies
* `.env` contains variables custom to the app we don't want other users to see
